# algorithms-and-data-structures

## Repository for storing finished and in-progress tasks for Algorithms and Data Structures university class.

Each "labXX" folder contains separate small project - mainly a data structure, an individual algorithm, or an algorithm using one of the implemented data structures.
Besides, NumPy framework is in use in some of the implementations.

This repository does not, and is not going to, have any sophisticated documentation, since not everything is in use, and things that ARE in use will have their documentation provided in different, appropiate places. However, all of the code provided in this repository can be used by anyone interested, for any purpose.
